/*
 * You're going to make a game â€” the objective of the game is to enter
 * enough change to equal exactly one dollar.
So, you're going to create a program that asks the user to enter the quantities for the following coins.

You'll ask them how many pennies would you like?
How many nickels would you like?
How many dimes?
And then, how many quarters?
What your program is going to do is count up the value of all of the change that they answered.

If it's exactly one dollar then they win the game.
If it's more than one dollar, then you need to tell them that it's more than one dollar and how much they went over.
If it's less than one dollar, tell them how much they went under.
